** Goals
Design a PCB for a split keyboard, similar to REDOX, ErgoDash, ErgoTravel, Kyria (not OSS) and NYX.
Other interesting Keyboards are Lily58, Lotus58, Sofle,

- it *must* be fully OSS
- it *must* support ZMK
  - it *could* have QMK support
- it *must* support 3D printed case and switch plate
- it *should* be split
- it *must* have columnar staggered layout
  - similar to Kyria or REDOX
- it *should* have a lot of keys:
  - it *must* have a thumb cluster
  - it *must* have 6 cols
    - it *should* have 7 cols
  - it *should* have a Number row
  - it *could* have arrow keys
- it *should* have MX style switches
- it *should* have HotSwap
  - preferred via Kailh sockets
- MCU *should* be mounted visible in the middle
  - MCU *could* have two sockets to choose orientation per side
- it *should* have PCB support for a switch and battery connections
- it *could* expose i2c for trackball support
- it *could* have RGB-LED for feedback regarding activated layers or modifier
  - it *does not need* any further LED stuff

*** Why not an existing keeb
- REDOX
  - is very close
    - no HotSwap
- Kyria
  - not OSS
  - to less keys
- ErgoDash,
- Zordiak is not OSS
- https://github.com/Pekaso/fortitude60
  - MCU is *Beetle USB 32u4* -> sot supported by ZMK


** How to start?
- base on something
  - REDOX
    - no HotSwap
  - ErgoDash
    - one less thumb key
