** Why not an existing keeb
- [[https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard][REDOX]]
  - is very close
    - no HotSwap in the open source variant
- [[https://github.com/tadfisher/nyx-kb/][NYX]]
- Kyria
  - not OSS
  - to less keys
- [[https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash][ErgoDash]],
- [[https://github.com/jpconstantineau/ErgoTravel][ErgoTravel]]
- Zordiak is not OSS
- [[https://github.com/Pekaso/fortitude60][fortitude60]]
  - MCU is *Beetle USB 32u4* -> not supported by ZMK
- [[https://github.com/KarlK90/yaemk-split-kb][YAEMK]]
  - not supported by ZMK

Other interesting Keyboards are Lily58, Lotus58, Sofle,

** Goals
- it *must* be fully OSS
- it *must* support ZMK
  - it *could* have QMK support
- it *must* support 3D printed case and switch plate
- it *should* be split
- it *must* have columnar staggered layout
  - similar to Kyria or REDOX
- it *should* have a lot of keys:
  - it *must* have a thumb cluster
  - it *must* have 6 cols
    - it *should* have 7 cols
  - it *should* have a Number row
  - it *could* have arrow keys
  - it *does not need* to have encoder support
- it *should* have MX style switches
- it *should* have HotSwap
  - preferred via Kailh sockets
- MCU *should* be mounted visible in the middle
  - MCU *could* have two sockets to choose orientation per side
    - I like them chip side up
  - MCU *should* use a standard interconnect like Pro Micro
- it *should* have PCB support for a switch and battery connections
- it *could* expose i2c for trackball support
- it *could* have RGB-LED for feedback regarding activated layers or modifier
  - it *does not need* any further LED stuff



** How to start?
- base on something
  - REDOX
    - no HotSwap
  - ErgoDash
    - one less thumb key
- from scratch
